First you have to enter your username as email which must contain a proper email format.
Then you have to enter your password with at least of 8 characters or numbers.
If you enter the user name and password correctly it will show a pop-up below the submit button showing login successful.
If you want to get the data that was given in the email and password section then go for the inspect.
After clicking on inspect, go for the network bar.
In the network bar you have to click on the post and then after you have to choose the payload option.
So before checking on the post option you must have to submit the details to post the data after opening the inspect section.

Thank you!
